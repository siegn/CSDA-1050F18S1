      " \"... Colour: gold. Nose: so very close! This is the 1999 at a higher strength, more or less. Same fat orchardy style, same herbal hints... I'm really all for this. With water: indeed, we're extremely close. This one may have a wee tad more earthy earth. Perhaps cedar wood? Mouth (neat): totally excellent, and rather different this time. The fatness is there again, and so is the honey, but it's also got rooty notes, between some kind of beetroot and sweet liquorice. Extremely creamy mouth feel. With water: maple syrup all over the place, plus a slice of pineapple and more honey. The earthy/rooty side is never far away. Finish: quite long, with a little more oranges, and plenty of fruit syrups. Perfect oaky balance. Comments: something extra. Really high-class, I'm starting to wonder if that's not a cunning plan, bottling some perfect 25yo malt whisky, wiping away the age statement, and using these as proof of the excellence of NAS whisky in general. Come on, I'm joking!  Score - 5 Stars (out of 5). (Serge Valentin, whiskyfun.com, Oct. 28, 2016)\"\n",

The distillery sent the craft brewer some old whisky casks for use in the maturation of its barrel-aged 200 Fathoms imperial stout. Then Teeling took back the beer-soaked containers, filling them anew with a mature small-batch whiskey and letting the liquid continue mellowing for a short 'finishing' period in contact with residue from the dark brew. Bottled at 46-per-cent alcohol, the result is luscious and uncommonly smooth, with rich chocolate, coffee, apricot-jam and spice notes and a big nutty character.

It starts off quite sweet, with bright candied orange and cherry notes leading the way, but segues into cinnamon spice and coffee cake before finishing short, dry, and slightly oaky.

In a glass, this Scotch is substantially darker than the average whisky, taking on a rich, reddish-amber hue in the light. Nose: Hits the nose with a tropical scent that I've found a lot of in Islay and nearby whiskies. This 12-year-old's nose is more forward with orange, citrusy notes but then quickly taking on an earthier, smokier oak scent with a touch of sea air. That more gradually transitions to a sweeter, earthy vanilla aroma with touches of sandalwood, pepper, and allspice. Palate: Eases onto the tongue with a creamy, malty, yet earthy vanilla flavor with just a touch of slightly bitter spices, almost like drinking rich, high-fat-milk latte with a shot of whisky in it and expertly seasoned with cloves. Meanwhile, it has a very gentle, but earthy undercurrent of peat that is easy to miss for its subtlety. That gentle, creamy flavor then swings in a much spicier direction  Score - 4 stars (out of 5).

Unlike anything you have ever tasted, Booker's is one of the only uncut, un-unaltered, straight-from-the-barrel, bourbons available today.

More than 200 years later, Basil Hayden's is a singular bourbon that bridges the flavor of rye whiskies and small batch bourbons together. Basil Hayden's is unequalled in that it utilizes twice as much rye in it as the other bourbons in the BEAM Small batch bourbon Collection. Enriched by a hint of peppermint, it impresses with notes of pepper balanced by slight citrus overtones, and a spicy, warming  finish. Aged eight years at a relatively mild 80 proof, Basil Hayden's has a broad appeal and is equally enjoyable alone or in cocktails such as a Juicy Basil and Basil Bubbly.\"\n",

The term 'hogshead' refers to the size of the cask, specifically 250 litres. Nearing 60% alcohol by volume, this was bottled at cask strength and will be best enjoyed with the addition of filtered water. Expect an expressive dram full of character.\"\n",
      " 'Best Irish Blended Limited Release at the 2018 World Whiskies Awards.'\n",
      " \"Bunnahabhain is considered the most restrained of the Islay whiskies: the emphasis is on the delicate interplay of the fruit, saline and oak-influenced vanilla and chocolate rather than on smoky peat. This 1980 was aged in Oloroso casks before being finished in Canasta Sherry casks. It will offer Bunnahabhain's noted balance and richness, with suggestions of brine, toffee, dried fruit and touches of mocha. A collector's dream.\"\n",
      " 'This is a blend of single malts from Brittany, Alsace and Cognac that were aged for 3-8 years. Following the final blend, this was aged for nearly another year. Look for this whisky to offer dried herbal tones with touches of peach, honey, leather and graham cracker.'\n",
      " 'This whisky was awarded a Gold Medal at the International Review of Spirits Awards 2009.'\n",
      " 'This single malt will offer up delicately framed tobacco notes along with some herbal tones on the nose, while the palate adds chocolate tones and spice amid the barley.'\n",
      " \"'Quarter casks bring out the rich sweet, fruity flavours, making whiskies taste like they have been matured for twelve years when they have been in the cask for a far shorter time. The peat on the other hand, tastes as big and fresh as its age. The result; 6 year old peat in what seems a twelve year old fruity spirit. Perfect!' 1000 Whiskies you must taste before you die'. Distillery was established in 1815. Laphroaig still operates its own floor maltings, which provide up to 20% of its requirements.\"]\n",
